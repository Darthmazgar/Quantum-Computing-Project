//Overview

Have decided to use matrix form for libraries
- use sparse matrices 
- Consider that not all states can be represented by matrix multiplication 

//Status of Theory 

Look into tensor products as potential section of theory for report - could be a section on tensor algebra as a whole 

Grover's Algorithm - compare to classical analog 


//Tasks

Sort out library of quantum functions
- to do this will need to write new methods to take in sparse matrices (consult lecture slides)
- sparse matrices, work out way to allow populated matrices to multiply with sparse ones etc.
- look at qc_simulator - the author uses a few ways to visualise the quantum computer - definitely have a look through 
  and consider using similar


// New Meeting Time !!
Will discuss later today - a time on Thursday seems best
