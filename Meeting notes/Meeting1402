Tasks

Library complete, add comments - as doc strings (three quotation marks) 

Define search algorithm - numerical task would be simpler as doesn't require classification system

Suggestion for quantum network - Rigetti lecture explained a method to create a class 'program' which performs the required 
gates on the register and appears to be a straightforward way to organise the 

For next time :

Deividas - Set up instructions for the structure of the quantum network to solve the network 
Ola - Write instructions for Shor's algorithm and cover, discuss point of algorithms
Freddie - Begin writing method for library, write comments for code 
Iain - write instructions 
Harsh - will discuss - can begin to implement quantum network on instructions 


Advice for method section - 'describe how program is structured, why you made the design choices you did, 
perhaps you could also say how you do things differently, how you went about designing the porgram
