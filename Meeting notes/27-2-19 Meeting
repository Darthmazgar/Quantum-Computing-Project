We think that the main structure is complete
Next steps to make a user friendly interface that can apply grovers and shors.

Areas of report that people can focus on.

Freddie - detailed project plan so we know what steps need to go in the report with specific sections.

Rough plan for who is writing what:
   People doing what on the report:
   Ola - Algorithm description and methodology for Shor's
   Iain - Grover's method
   Freddie - Results (Grover's) & conclusion 
   Harsh - Method for building quantum simulator
   Davidas - Results (Shor's)
   
Aim to have Grover's done over the next few days.
Aim to start some more indepth writing.
